This is just a PaymentPlatform code in Android.
It used to work for chinese mobile payment, it should be out of date now. so you could just use this 
as your begining code.

1.support alipay.
2.support mm payment.
3.support sms send.

All image resources was not included here, they were packaged into a jar file with aapt. 
More detail in how to package them just check the link below.

In fact, it was just one step of process in package APK.
mktemp -u /tmp/resources-XXXXXXXXXX.zip
~/bin/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130514/sdk/build-tools/android-4.2.2/aapt package -f -M ~/Code/AndroidStudio/workspace/PlatformResProvider/AndroidManifest.xml -F /tmp/resources-gNHycTdnvn.zip -S ~/Code/AndroidStudio/workspace/PlatformResProvider/res -I /home/michael/bin/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130514/sdk/platforms/android-17/android.jar
cp /tmp/resources-XXXXXXXXXX.zip ï½ž/Desktop/

so if you want to use resource file, just read it from jar file. 

Sadly, the resource index was really coded ugly..If you want , you could use tool to automatic create them into a class file.

And the view in it was all written by hand with no resource xml... I just thought I was crasy...
